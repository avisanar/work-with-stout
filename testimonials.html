"I really cannot say enough good things about Stout Executive Search. I wasn't really looking for a new role, but Jacob reached out to me to setup a profile and to get to know me. After learning more about my experience, he floated a role my way that I listened to. Before I knew it, I had landed an amazing role for a company that really cares for their employees. Jacob helped me throughout the interview process, and was excellent in communicating with me and touching base. If you are looking to expand your network, this search team is the one to do it!" </p><br><br>

"I had a wonderful experience with Marvelyn and her team at Stout Executive Search. I wasn’t proactively looking for a new role but talked with Marvelyn and was impressed by how she took the time to listen and understand my background and interests. Their process is much deeper and more holistic in order to truly understand what it is each candidate is looking for. Jacob was a great resource throughout the process and brought forward an opportunity a week after our first conversation, which I ended up interviewing for and accepting a few weeks later. I felt like they were there for me the entire time, and even followed up after I started to see how I was doing. If you’re even open to exploring what’s available, I highly recommend talking with Stout Executive Search!" </p><br><br>
